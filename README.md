Sigil Generator.

## What are Sigils?

A sigil is a symbol created for a specific magical purpose.
It is a symbolic representation of a wish or intention,
condensed into an abstract form so it can be carried by the subconscious.

### How This App Works

1. Write your intention or wish in the text field.
2. The app removes vowels and repeated letters to create the base of the sigil.
3. A cryptographic hash is generated from this base, ensuring a unique pattern.
4. Using a system of angles, distances, and numerology, the hash is translated into a geometric design and a specific color, creating your personal sigil.
